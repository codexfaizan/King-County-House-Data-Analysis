# King-County-House-Data-Analysis

This project the task is to build a regression model to help real estate agencies to check house price settings set by house owners in the King County.
The provided dataset has a large number of outliers in each feature and some of the samples are outside the King County area. We have to make use of various analysis techniques to either remove these outliers or standardize the data in a proper way.
In this analysis we will focus on helping Real estate Agencies finding what indicators drive prices in house market.
